https://github.com/LudumDare30/Network-Admin-Simulator-3000

Game mechanics:
Player manages network connections in a country
Player would reroute connections if some cables are down so all computers in the country are always connected
Player must respond to complaints and support tickets
  Limited resources:
money
websites
reputation (points)
personel?


Player starts with $X resources for $Y connections
    Player must establish first outside connection
        agreements are bargins between resources and available assets
    Limited resources means limited connections, players eventually sacrifice one deal for others
        Either party is capable of terminating the connection as long as:
            the terms of the agreement are being met or
            the parties have the resources/assets necessary to uphold the agreement


Score = Number of websites we have access toy
    upholding agreements are a bonus
    having a connection on a violated agreement is still points, but less points





Things -Gamah has to install...
 a browser
git

ranks and points:

+ shop:
    - hardware:
        * router ( gives more connections [ tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, tier 4 ]
            ( tier 1 gives more 2 connections but reduces quality over all connections )
            ( tier 2 gives more 1 connection and doesn't reduce quality over all connections )
            ( tier 3 gives more 2 connections and doesn't alter quality over connections )
            ( tier 4 gives more 1 connection and increases bandwidth )
        * upgrade network ( increases bandwidth [ copper, gold, fiber ] ) 
            ( copper )
            ( hardened copper )
            ( gold )
            ( hardened gold )
